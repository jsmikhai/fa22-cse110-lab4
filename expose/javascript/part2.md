1. 3 will be printed to the console because the loop iterates through i = 0, 1, and 2.
2. 150 will be printed to the console because this is the last discounted price in the array of prices.
3. 150.00 will be printed to the console because this is the last discounted price in the array of prices and math.round is used to add the decimal places.
4. [50.00, 100.00, 150.00] will be printed to the console because these are all the final prices of the array of prices.
5. This code will cause an error because you are defining a variable using let inside of a for loop. The let keyword can only be used to define a specific variable one time and in this case, the for loop is ran through a total of 3 times.

    1.  alert( student.name );
    2.  alert(student['Grad Year'])
    3.  student.greeting();
    4.  student['Favorite Teacher']['name'];
    5.  student.courseLoad[0];
13. 
    1.  32 because int 2 is mapped to string 2.
    2.  1 because string 3 is mapped to int 3.
    3.  3 because null was converted to a 0.
    4.  3null because null was converted to a string.
    5.  4 because true is casted to be 1.
    6.  0 because null and false both were casted to be 0.
    7.  3undefined because undefined was casted to be a string.
    8.  nan, which is not a number, because 3 cannot be subtracted by an undefined number.
14. 
    1.  true because string 2 is converted to int.
    2.  false because the ascii value of 12 is less than that of 2.
    3.  true because one is converted to match the other's type.
    4.  false because === does not allow for any type conversion.
    5.  false because 1 is not equal to 2.
    6.  true because true is the 2nd boolean value.
15. The difference between == and === is that: == converts the variable values to the same type before performing comparison. This is called type coercion. === does not do any type conversion (coercion) and returns true only if both values and types are identical for the two variables being compared.
